With a few exceptions, theme variables generally fall into 4 or 5 variants within broader categories.

The broad categories are:
| Name          | Description | Example Use |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Header        | Basically just the header bar colors. | Header bar |
| Primary       | Used to indicate most important actions. | Download Button |
| Secondary     | Used to indicate secondary actions. | Zoom buttons |
| Tertiary      | Used to indicate additional actions (secondary/tertiary is often arbitrary, based on what looks nice). | Editor tour bubbles |
| Target1       | A target-specific set of subtle colors. | Blockly workspace |
| Target2       | Additional target-specific set of subtle colors. | Sim sidebar |
| Target3       | Additional target-specific set of subtle colors. | Toolbox |
| Neutral1      | A target-agnostic set of subtle colors. | Modals body |
| Neutral2      | A target-agnostic set of subtle colors. | Modal footer |
