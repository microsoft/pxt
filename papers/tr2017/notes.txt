- real language (Static TypeScript, good for teaching programming)
- language and runtime support simple programming model
- mention huge growth of microcontroller-based systems
- idea that end-users will want to customize systems, maker, educational
- design principles: Anything, Anyone, Anywhere
  - 1. Anything. efficient in RAM and Flash, don't care as much about CPU cycles
  -    differences in "shape" of microcontroller from desktop
  -    Storage to Processor capability
  - 2. Anyone. program anywhere (web app, uf2)
  - 3. Anywhere. low-floor high-ceiling 
       - programming model (events + non-preemptive language)
       - (blockly, typescript, C++)
- what can we say at a high-level about numbers
  - sessions across all devices
  - countries, browsers, operatings systems
- James to work on codal.tex to make examples align with Figure 1
