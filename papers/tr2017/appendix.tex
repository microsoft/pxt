% In STS, $S$ is a subtype of a type $T$ if one of the following is true:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $S$ and $T$ are identical types;
% \item $S$ is the Undefined type;
% \item $S$ is the Null type and $T$ is not the Undefined type;
% \item $S$ is an enum type and $T$ is the primitive type Number;
% \item $S$ is a string literal type and $T$ is the primitive type String;
% \item $S$ and $T$ are class types and all the following are true:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $S$ is derived from $T$ (via \emph{extends} clauses);
%   \item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds;
% \end{itemize}
% \item $S$ is a class/record type and $T$ is a record type and
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds;
% \end{itemize}
% \item $S$ and $T$ are function types such that all the following hold:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $S$ has at least as many parameters as $T$;
%   \item each parameter type in $T$ is a subtype of the corresponding parameter type in $S$;
%   \item the result type of $T$ is Void, or the result type of $S$ is a subtype of that of $T$;
% \end{itemize}
% \item $S$ and $T$ are array types and all the following hold:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $T$ has a numeric index signature with element type $U$, 
%     and $S$ has a numeric index signature with element type $V$
%     such that $V$ is a subtype of $U$;
% \item checkProps($S$,$T$) holds.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% Given types $S$ and $T$, checkProps($S$,$T$) holds if for each property $N$ in $T$, 
% $S$ has a property $M$ where all of the following are true:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $M$ and $N$ have the same name;
% \item the type of $M$ is a subtype of the type of $N$;
% \item $M$ and $N$ are both public, or $M$ and $N$ are both 
%       private (protected) and originate in the same declaration, 
%       or $N$ is protected and $S$ is a class derived from class $T$
% \end{itemize}
