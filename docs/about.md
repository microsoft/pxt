# About

The Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT) is a framework for creating special-purpose programming experiences for beginners,
especially focused on computer science education. PXT's underlying programming language 
is a subset of TypeScript (leaving out JavaScript dynamic features).

The main features of PXT are:

* a [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)-based code editor along with converter to JavaScript
* a [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor)-based text editor with enhanced, robust auto-completion and auto-correction powered by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* extensibility support to define new blocks in TypeScript or C++
* markdown-based documentation system with built-in macros to render block snippets
* an ARM Thumb machine code emitter
* a command-line package manager

The Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT) is currently developed at Microsoft Research, Redmond.
