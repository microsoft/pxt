# About

**Microsoft MakeCode** is a framework for creating special-purpose programming experiences for beginners,
especially focused on computer science education. 

Microsoft MakeCode is based on the open source project [Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt). ``Microsoft MakeCode`` is the name in the user-facing editors, 
``PXT`` is used in all the GitHub sources.

MakeCode's underlying programming language 
is a [subset of TypeScript](/language), omitting JavaScript dynamic features.

The main features of MakeCode are:

* a [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)-based code editor along with converter to JavaScript
* a [Monaco](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor)-based text editor with enhanced, robust auto-completion and auto-correction powered by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* extensibility support to [define blocks](/defining-blocks) via TypeScript or C++
* markdown-based documentation system with built-in macros to render block snippets
* an ARM Thumb machine code emitter
* a command-line package manager

MakeCode is currently developed at Microsoft, Redmond.
