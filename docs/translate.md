# Help translate

Microsoft MakeCode supports localized content for the MakeCode editors, their documentation, and the document pages on the [makecode.com](https://makecode.com/docs) website. Support for localization lets people use, learn, and enjoy MakeCode in their own language.

Localization of MakeCode is made possible by the contributions of translators all over the world working to get MakeCode translated into many languages. Our translations are managed by [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/makecode), a translation management platform for crowd-based localization. It is free to join and you can volunteer to translate parts of the MakeCode editors and website.

## Crowdin project

Our Crowdin translation project contains the text resources for the MakeCode UI, programming blocks, and content pages.

* **[Microsoft MakeCode Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/makecode)**

If you want to help with translating the MakeCode project, please sign in to Crowdin (or [join](https://crowdin.com/join) first if you don't already have an account) and send us a translator request.

## Get started #get-started

After you've joined a translation team and are signed in, choose the **[language](/translate/languages)** you're translating for. Under that language you will find **[files](/translate/files)** for the common text and folders for the different editors (also called _targets_). You begin by choosing a file listed or a file in one of the target folders. In these files are strings, or text, that are the **[parts](/translate/parts)** of MakeCode you will translate.

When you translate, you have the **[role](/translate/roles)** of a _translator_ which lets you suggest and save any new or better translation for a string. A _proofreader_ reviews your translations and will approve them if they are accurate. Other translators may suggest a different one if they think yours is incorrect and you can discuss it to agree on which one is correct. Once your translation is approved, it will appear online for that string when your language is selected in the editor or website.

If you're more comfortable translating while actually using and seeing the strings in the editor, you can add your translations with the **[in context translation](/translate/in-context)** feature. This lets you do much of the translation work outside of the Crowdin website.
