## New features in this Beta

In addition to general bug fixes, here’s a run-down of the new features for the next release:

* **Functions with parameters** – Hooray!!! This was one of the most requested features from educators. Now when you make a function, you have the option to add _Text_, _Boolean_ or _Number_ type parameters. Try out the **Edit Function** feature and let us know what you think!

* **Green Screen** – For those of you who do screen recordings as part of your lessons, this is a cool new feature that will allow you to overlay your webcam onto the MakeCode workspace. Wow,  you can demonstrate code and hardware at the same time! You can access the **Green Screen** from the **Project Settings** menu.

* **My Projects** view – Also one of the top requested features – the ability to see all your projects, and then open, delete, and duplicate the projects.

* **Tutorial Progress** – We’ve added a way to save your tutorial progress so, if you have to exit a tutorial in the middle, you can jump back in where you left off.

* **Updated Servo blocks** – For those of you using servo motors with your micro:bit projects, we have improved the blocks in the **Servo** extension to help you calibrate and better control your servo motors.

* **Radio Received blocks** – this has been a pain point for many teachers. Students will often manually rename the **Radio Received** values expecting the data types to change also. We are trying to solve this by using fixed names for the received values – so they will not show up in the **Variables** Toolbox drawer and you will not be able to rename them. Please take a look and let us know what you think. Note, all projects using the old radio blocks will still work.

* **Convert to String block** – in the **Text** Toolbox category, we’ve had the **Parse to Number** block for a while now that allows you to convert strings to Numbers, but we haven’t had an easy way to allow you to convert other values into Strings. Until now! Introducing the **Convert to String** block that can take numbers and Boolean values and convert them into Strings.

So, if you’re super adventurous, you may find some additional goodies in the Experiments section of the site (if you can find it).

Happy Making and Coding!
