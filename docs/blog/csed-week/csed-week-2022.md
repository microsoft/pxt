# Computer Science Education Week 2022

**Posted on November 14th, 2022 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

Along with the holidays, [Computer Science Education Week](https://www.csedweek.org) is coming up December 5th - 11th. This is an annual event to raise the visibility of computer science in education, and to inspire all teachers and students to do an "Hour of Code" during this week.

At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person on the planet to achieve more. And with technology being pervasive in the modern workplace, this mission extends to empowering every young person with the opportunity to learn computer science and develop career-ready skills. In the US, only 1 in 2 high schools offer a CS class, only 5.6% of high school students are enrolled in a CS class, and only 32% of these enrolled students are female.¹

Every year we create some fun, simple coding activities that anyone can do during an Hour of Code - either in your classroom, or at home.  And you don't have to wait until December to try them out, these are all available for free today - check them out below.

Join us to help inspire the next generation of technology creators by supporting inclusive CS education for all!

## MakeCode for micro:bit

If you have micro:bits in the classroom, there are many fun introductory projects that will light up imaginations and creativity through physical computing. Here are a couple examples:

**[Which Way Now?](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/which-way-now)** - Your micro:bit knows the way!  Code a program that will show you which way to walk when you shake it.

**[Micro:bit Dice](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/dice)** - Transform your micro:bit into a six-sided digital dice! Use the accelerometer and the pick random function to code this simple project.
