# Computer Science Education Week 2025

**Posted on November 12th, 2025 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

[Computer Science Education Week](https://www.csedweek.org) is the time every year where schools all across the country shine a light on the importance of computing and technical education. As **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is an important part of computer science, the theme for this year is how "CS Powers AI Innovation". As a result, we are encouraging everyone to do an [Hour of AI](https://csforall.org/hour-of-ai) for CS Education Week this year.

Every year Microsoft creates some fun, simple activities that anyone can do during CS Ed Week – either in your classroom, or at home. And you don’t have to wait until December to try them out, these are all available for **free** today – check them out below.

Join us to help inspire the next generation of technology creators by supporting inclusive CS and AI education for all!

## MakeCode Arcade Bug Arena

Welcome to the AI Bug Arena where the smartest bugs battle for glory! This Skillmap introduces students to AI through a fun, iterative, game-based learning approach. In this activity, students will code their own AI Bug algorithms to compete against other AI bugs to cover the screen with paint.

## Minecraft Education First Night

Surviving your first night in Minecraft is a classic challenge. But what if you had an AI partner to help you? "The First Night" turns a classic first-night setup into a safety-by-design challenge, available as a free demo in Minecraft Education. With an AI helper, you’ll plan, prototype, automate Minecraft tasks while learning how to code in Blocks and Python, and see how an agentic AI can be used. Can you build shelter before the sun sets? Join Hour of AI today!

## Micro:bit CreateAI

If you have micro:bits in the classroom, this is a great time to dip your toe in the AI waters with physical computing! Using the **micro:bit CreateAI** feature, you can train a machine learning model to recognize gestures and movement with the micro:bit. And it’s much easier than it sounds! Start off with the CreateAI taster lesson.

## Visual Studio Code for Education Slither Slam

The Visual Studio Code for Education Slither Slam activity is designed to give students ages 13-18 a fun, hands-on experience with AI prompting and code generation. In this activity, students will prompt an LLM to generate code for their own "SnakeBot" character to compete against other AI snakes in a game.
