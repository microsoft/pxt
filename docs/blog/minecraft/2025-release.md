MakeCode Minecraft 2025 Update

Posted on October 13, 2025 by Jaqster

The MakeCode fall update for Minecraft Education is here!

Here’s a run-down of all the new features and improvements:

Entity updates

We have the adorable new spawn egg update!!! No more guessing – now picking mobs to spawn is easier than ever!

In addition to the visual update, we’ve also added a few new mobs:

· Animals – you can now spawn the Agent, and a Happy Ghast to ride

· There’s a slew of new monsters as well – Creaking, Ender Dragon, Iron Golem, Piglin Brute, Snow Golem, and Wither

And just in time for Halloween, there are some new blocks and items you can code with, including candles in different colors, new plants like wildflowers, eye blossoms and firefly bush, pale oak blocks, and harnesses in different colors.

Get weather blocks

We added a couple new Gameplay coding blocks this release related to the weather.

Here’s an example of a program that will create an automatic umbrella for you!

Keyboard Controls

Bringing over this accessibility feature from the work we did with the Micro:bit Foundation and Blockly, we now have Keyboard Controls enabled in MakeCode for Minecraft. This allows people who prefer using a keyboard instead of the mouse to navigate around the workspace, and place and move code blocks using keyboard controls.

To turn on the keyboard controls, in the MakeCode editor, click on the Settings menu and select Keyboard Controls to toggle this feature on.

You can also just press the Tab key when you open the editor to get the shortcut menu and then select Enter.

When you activate keyboard controls, a help pane will appear with information on the keys to press to navigate around the editor.

Python and JavaScript Tutorials

Based on feedback from teachers using Python and JavaScript in MakeCode, we are making a slight tweak to how we display tutorials. We normally use both the left side pane and the top pane to display tutorial instructions based on the screen size. However, this meant that lines of code would be cut off in the side pane view.


<TutorialSidePane.png>

So, going forward, any Python or JavaScript tutorials will always display in the top pane. And you can resize the instruction pane up or down to view more or less of the instructions.

New code execution behavior

A subtle change, but worth calling out is that we’ve done away with auto-run. In the past, we would automatically run your code every time you went from the Code Builder window to the game.

However, now you must always click the Play button to run your code.

Just clicking outside the coding window to the game, or closing the Code Builder window won't automatically execute code any more. This change was made to provide a more consistent experience and avoid unexpected behavior.

New Extensions

We added a couple new extensions for your coding pleasure!

Events

The Events extension adds some additional event blocks that allow you to respond to things that happen in the game. For example, you can respond to events like certain blocks being broken or placed, certain items being used, dropped or acquired, or player or mob events.

Click on Extensions in the Toolbox and select the Events extension.

This is an example program that uses the Blocks Broken event to keep track of the number and type of blocks broken in a certain amount of time: [Mining Competition](https://makecode.com/_dDV0yqT2bcW3).

File Read & Write

This extension allows you to read and write data to a file on your computer. Note that this extension is not currently supported on Chromebook or iOS devices, so it is not displayed by default in the extension gallery, but if you type “File” and press Enter in the Search bar, it will appear.

This is an example program that will use the Agent to detect minerals and write to a file: [Minerals](https://makecode.com/_XXRRUj0A7T6r).

For more information on this extension, please see the [File Read Write with MakeCode]( https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/38490275582100-File-Read-Write-with-MakeCode) support article.


We hope you enjoy these updates, and we can’t wait to see what you create next in Minecraft!

Happy Making and Coding!
