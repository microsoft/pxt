# Interview with MakeCode Arcade Game Maker

**Posted on December 19th, 2025 by [Jaqster](https://github.com/jaqster)**

_Interview from December, 2025_

As a great way to close out 2025, we sat down with MakeCode game developer and [Code 
Ninjas](https://www.codeninjas.com) Sensei, Ethan Battaglia, to learn more about what 
it’s like learning and creating games with MakeCode Arcade.

Ethan’s very fun [JetChamp](https://ethansguild.github.io/jetchamp) game, was 
submitted as an entry in Code Ninja’s recent [Champions Game 
Jam](https://forms.codeninjas.com/gamejam-champions). You can see all the 
submissions [here](https://blog.codeninjas.com/champions-game-jam).

## Tell us a little bit about JetChamp – what is the game about, and what is the game play like?

JetChamp is my submission to the Code Ninjas Champions game jam! It’s about how 
Yellow Bull (a fictional energy drink company) is looking for a new stunt artist. They decide 
to hold a jetpack competition to determine who becomes the stunt artist and earns the 
title of JetChamp!

The gameplay is full of timing-based challenges where the player must use their jetpack to 
fly at just the right time to pass each obstacle. There are five levels in total, with each level 
building off of the previous ones by introducing new and exciting game mechanics!

## How did you come up with the idea for it?

When brainstorming ideas for the Champions game jam, an image of a podium with people 
at the base of it reaching for the top appeared in my mind. It was that sense of height 
difference - where everyone started at the ground - which inspired me to make a game 
where the player must keep flying higher.

## What was your favorite part about building this game?

In “Foddian” games like Getting Over It and Jump King, you lose considerable progress if 
you make a mistake. This forces the player to plan their next move and execute it perfectly. 
So, once the player pushes past an obstacle, they feel immensely satisfied and relieved. 
Building these moments into the game by using clever tilemap design and checkpoints was 
easily the most enjoyable part of making this game.

## What was the biggest challenge?

For me, the hardest part of the game was designing the art for the player. I needed the 
player to have a black outline to help with gameplay readability, but I also needed the 
player to be smaller than one tile, or 16x16 pixels! I went through three or four iterations 
and multiple hours of playtests until I was happy with the final design, and I fit it into 13x14 
pixels! The final art for the player also influenced my storytelling in the intro cutscene to 
say that the world is inhabited by “calculator droids”.

## How did you learn about MakeCode Arcade, and how did you build up your game development skills?

A while back at Code Ninjas, the curriculum was changed so that MakeCode Arcade was 
the primary platform. As a Sensei, I felt obligated to master it, so I started building barebones recreations of popular games in MakeCode Arcade, including Pac-Man, Agar.io, 
Minesweeper, and Just Shapes and Beats. While building these recreations, I also 
sprinkled some of my own games in, including these genres: platformer, time-based 
survival, incremental, and puzzle!

I’ve been making games ever since one of the earlier updates to Geometry Dash 
introduced the level editor. It allowed me to build custom levels and learn how to create a 
strong, cohesive experience from nothing.

## Tell us a little bit about Code Ninjas and what you do there?

At Code Ninjas, kids (or Ninjas) learn how to code by starting with block coding in 
MakeCode Arcade and progressing to professional game engines like Unity and Godot. 
They practice their skills by building dozens of projects, answering interactive quizzes, and 
solving problems in example code. As a Code Ninjas Sensei, I:

1.
2.
3. Teach the fundamental rules behind
4. coding
5.
6.
7.
8. Debug complex issues in Ninja-made
9. games
10.
11.
12.
13. Inspire Ninjas to build their dream
14. games
15.

## Tell us about Extra Life and what they do?

[Extra Life]( https://www.extra-life.org/home) is a fundraising program (run by Children’s 
Miracle Network Hospitals) where streamers raise money by holding gaming marathons. 
The streamer chooses a specific hospital that is part of Children’s Miracle Network, and 
schedules a marathon stream. All donations raised during this marathon go to the selected 
children’s hospital!

In October of 2025, Extra Life and Code Ninjas came together and created the Champions 
game jam where the winners each get $500USD donated to their local children’s hospital!

## Any advice you have for aspiring game developers?

If you are ever struggling with coming up with ideas for a game to make, it’s okay with using 
some of your favorite games as a jumping-off point. A lot of people get stressed out trying 
to make every single aspect of their game “original”, when really all a game needs to be is 
FUN! The best games are often the ones that take existing ideas and make them better.

Huge thanks to Ethan for helping inspire new generations of game makers at Code Ninjas, 
and for making a super fun JetChamp game with MakeCode Arcade!

Happy Making and Coding!
