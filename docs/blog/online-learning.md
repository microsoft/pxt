# Online Learning Resources

**Posted on March 10th, 2020**

Many schools have closed or might soon close to help prevent the spread of illness. Educators may need to find ways to promote and continue learning for students without a classroom. We thought that it might be helpful to again highlight the learning resources we have with MakeCode that support online learning.

## Live Streaming from the MakeCode team!

To help families with school closures, we're the bringing learning to you! The MakeCode team will live stream daily sessions
on how to learn coding using MakeCode editors. All streams will be recorded and available on the [MakeCode YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCye7YlvFUUQ1dSy0WZZ1T_Q).
