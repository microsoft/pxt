# Retiring Touch Develop

Dear Touch Develop Community:

We wish to inform you that the Touch Develop (TD) service (at www.touchdevelop.com) 
will be shut down permanently on May 23, 2018. This means that all cloud hosted TD 
resources (scripts, images, etc.) will no longer be available from May 23, 2018 onward. 

See the [Touch Develop GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/touchdevelop) for instructions on how to save scripts you wish to keep and run TD locally on your own machine. Please note that this requires expertise with developer technologies such GitHub and Node.js, among others.

We’d like to provide some history about TD, so you better understand our decision to retire it:
- In 2010, Microsoft Research (MSR) started the TD project. In the beginning, TD was a smartphone app for Windows Phone 7, using a cloud service to store and share scripts.
- In 2012, we invested in a TD web app to serve users across more platforms - the TD smartphone app was eventually retired.
- In 2015, TD was used as the platform for the BBC micro:bit, a small microcontroller-based device deployed initially in UK schools and now around the world by the [micro:bit Education Foundation](http://microbit.org), as well as Microsoft’s *Creative Computing for Games and Apps* (CCGA) course.
- In 2016, the learnings from TD, micro:bit, and CCGA informed the creation of a new programming experience called Microsoft MakeCode, based on Blockly and JavaScript. You can use MakeCode, free of charge, at https://www.makecode.com. For an introduction to MakeCode, see the MakeCode [blog](/blog/makecode-overview).

Come May 23, 2018 [Microsoft MakeCode is replacing Touch Develop](/touchdevelop). 
We also are developing a [sprite-based game engine](/td2mkcd) for MakeCode 
and a new course on game programming, in the spirit of CCGA.
