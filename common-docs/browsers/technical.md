# Technical information about browser support

Visiting [@homeurl@][] requires that you use a recent version of a modern
browser, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera.
This is because the editor uses modern web technologies such as [web
workers][] to enable compiling [TypeScript][] in the browser, and includes the
same [Monaco][] editor that powers [Visual Studio Code][].

Most modern browsers automatically update themselves. In some environments,
such as schools, these automatic updates are disabled for security. **We
strongly recommend that you use the most recent version of any of these
browsers**.
