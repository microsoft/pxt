# Adding content to the home page

The Editor home page contains galleries of card links to projects, tutorials, lessons, videos, and other content sources. Many content items featured on the home page are hosted at the editor's website while some other items are from external sources.

Much of content available on the home page is developed or selected by the MakeCode Team. Content from other contributors is welcomed though and can be featured in the home page galleries.

* The instructions should be well written and easy to follow.

* Content will be reviewed and approved by the MakeCode Team.

## What you need to submit

To list a content item on the home page, you need to provide:

1. A full URL for the item. For a tutorial, a complete tutorial URL is needed (see https://makecode.com/writing-docs/user-tutorials for more details).
2. A brief one or two sentence description of what your content is or does (preferably in English for localization and is 30 words or less).

## Featured content

To request featured space in the Home Page banner carousel, the requirements are similar to gallery items except for the image size. We require a link, a short description, and a "Hero" image that is 2100x500 pixels. Please note that banner space is very limited and approval for items included there is very selective.
