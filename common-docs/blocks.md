# Blocks language

### @description Language constructs for the Block editor.

## #blocksbase
Blocks snap into each other to define the program that your @boardname@ will run.
Blocks can be event (buttons, shake, ...) or need to be snapped into an event to run.
The [on-start](/blocks/on-start) event runs first.

```namespaces
for (let i = 0;i<5;++i) {}
if (true){}
let x = 0;
Math.randomRange(0,5);
```
