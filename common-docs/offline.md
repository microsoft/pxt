# Offline editing

## Web application

**@homeurl@ is an HTML5 web application** that automatically gets cached locally by your browser. 
Once the web app is loaded and you have compiled at least once, you will have all the code needed to work without an internet connection.

## Command line interface

For more experience users, you can download the entire toolchain and use the [command line interface](/cli) (CLI) to compile 
and deploy your scripts locally. PXT provides a great out-of-the-box experience using [Visual Studio Code](/code), 
a lightweight cross-platform code editor.
