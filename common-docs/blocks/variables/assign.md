# Assignment Operator

Use an equals sign to make a [variable](/blocks/variables/var) store the [number](/types/number) 
or [string](/types/string) you say.

When you use the equals sign to store something in a variable, the equals sign is called
an *assignment operator*, and what you store is called a *value*.

## ~hint

You can use the assignment operator with variables of 
every [type](/types). A *type* is which kind of thing
a variable can store, like a number or string.
