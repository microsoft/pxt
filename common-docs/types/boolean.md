# Boolean

true or false.

A Boolean has one of two possible values: `true`; `false`.  Boolean (logical) operators (*and*, *or*, *not*) take Boolean inputs and yields a Boolean value. Comparison operators on other types ([numbers](/types/number), [strings](/types/string) yields a Boolean value.

The following blocks represent the true and false Boolean values, which can be plugged in anywhere a Boolean value is expected:

```blocks
true;
false;
```
